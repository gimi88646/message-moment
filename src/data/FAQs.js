    Question: "How long will my chat data be available for?",
    Answer: `Chat data will be available for as long as the chat link remains active however this is subject to the Message Expiry time which will determine the length of time in which each user’s entered message will appear until it is no longer visible to anyone in the chat session. The Message Expiry time is set once by one user and applies to all users. Once it is set, it will appear inactive (grayed out) for all users indicating it has been set and what it has been set to. It cannot be changed for the remainder of chat session. It is the responsibility of the users to capture or save any information they want to retain, as the platform is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Whilst not essential, for additional peace of mind, consider launching your browser in its private mode. This way, your visit to our site will not be recorded in your browser history.`,
